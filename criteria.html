        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>Since Criteria is a pre-employment service, our audience is targeted towards HR coordinators. Our job as a service is to make hiring easier for HR professionals. Studies have shown that traditional methods of hiring can be exhausting and waste a lot of time.</p><p>The challenge placed onto me was figuring a way to market Criteria’s services to HR professionals. In the branding, we wanted to make Criteira more approachable. We understood that trying out new software can be intimidating, and that HR professionals can see our software as being not user-friendly. Therefore, within our style guide, we looked into how we could make our brand more approachable. Originally with digital ads, we focused on using imagery with people in a corporate setting. We did this because we wanted to establish ourselves as a viable source. We also wanted to appeal to big corporate businesses. However, as we studied our market and realized that a bulk of the companies that used our services were small  and medium sized  companies, we decided to change out messaging and design to cater more to that audience.</p>

        <h4>Design Process</h4>
        <p>The first approach into entering the design process was to take a look at old and current design creatives. The marketing and design team came together and had meetings on building what our mission statement is. As a service, what were our company values and how were we releasing content that matched those values. After solidfying that at our current state, our core value was to be empathetic to users and gain their trust. We looked into how we could rebrand our content, so that it would tie in with the audience better. We started off with doing market research and going to HR conventions. We observed our competitors strengths and weaknesses, and used that knowledge to apply it to our design. Currently in the marketplace, most ads are still using stock photography of corporate working professionals. They use language around how to profit off your business by making better hires. So in order to differ ourselves from the marketplace, we starting using stock photos that had working professionals in semi-professional outfits. We wanted our ads to appeal more as a lifestyle. Our messaging around ads targeted struggles that HR professionals go through. </p>

        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>With the rebanding of our brand to target a different audience, the marketing and design team were able to have a better idea of how to better update our content to serve our audience. It opened a new door of opportunities for us to come up with new campaigns. The rebranding has helped Crtieria evolve internally.</p>
