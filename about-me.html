        <h3>I am Christie, a UX Designer from Los Angeles. </h3>
        <p>Tl;dr: One of my fondest memories growing up was watching my cousin draw. Her sketches of superheroes introduced me to the world of manga. Manga inspired me to continue sketching and allow my imagination to go wild. When I was accepted to the University of California, Irvine, I was able to find my purpose to create. For me, creating art was to leave a part of myself into the world. I wanted to be remembered. I would become a graphic designer for the next six years after graduation, and I was fine until I realized that I was stuck in my career. My director mentioned creating impactful designs to stand out and that is where I discovered the field of UX Design. Now I create design works so that when the time comes when I do leave, at least I left knowing that my work made someone’s life a little easier.<br>

        <br>When I was younger, I spent a lot of time playing with my cousins. My favorite cousin was Amy. Amy was quiet and reserved, and I would say I’m the complete opposite. At one of our family gatherings, I saw Amy sitting in an empty room with a pencil in her hand sketching on a white sheet of paper. I walked over to her and peeked over her shoulder, and was captivated at observing the impact of pencil to paper.<br>

        <br>I was accepted at the University of California, Irvine for their Fine Arts program. Art at this point in my life was something that I was good at, and was the reason to why I decided to pursue it. I wasn’t sure where a bachelors in art would take me, but I decided to go with it. In order to graduate, we were required to write an artist statement. The idea was to find your purpose to create. In my statement, I talked about how I saw myself floating in the sky, gazing the world underneath me. I talked about leaving my trace behind when I leave this world. At that time, the idea of not existing in the world was scary, but leaving something behind would give me immortality.<br>

        <br>After graduating, I worked with companies of all industries and sizes. I enjoyed my job as a designer. My job was to make things pretty. Also, I was definitely leaving my mark around with the flyers and banner ads that I had created. Life was good until I realized that I was stuck. I had reached a point where I was good at what I did, but as a designer I was just like every other designer out there. My director told me that anyone can be a designer. Anyone can lay out some color/fonts and put it together. However, not everyone can make thoughtful designs. I took in what he said, and discovered the field of UX Design. It all made sense now, I loved watching my cousin draw because I was able to witness the process of creation. I chased after the idea of leaving my mark behind, not to make myself feel immortal, but so that I would leave knowing that my speciality as a research designer helped to create delightful user-centric experiences.<br>

        <br>If you are interested in working with me or picking at my brain, feel free to contact me. I would love to chat. </p>
