        <h5>Strategy</h5>
        <p>I ask a lot of questions, but I'm not trying to be annoying. I ask questions to make sure I am aligned with your expectations for a project. This stage includes doing market research and competitive analysis.</p>

      <div class= "structure">
        <h5>Structure</h5>
        <p>Who doesn't like a great foundation? At this stage, I analyze data received from my research to prioritize user stories that would determine the information hierarchy of the project. Here is where the MVP is created.</p>

      <div class= "visual-design">
        <h5>Visual Design</h5>
        <p>The best designs are the ones that evoke feelings. I convert wireframes into their final design look. In order to provide teh best experience of the product, I create a dynamic prototype that displays the final results before having it sent to development.</p>
