        <h3>Me in a Nutshell</h3>
          <p>Growing up, art has always been a part of my life. I have a bachelors in Fine Arts and a minor in Digital Arts from the University of California, Irvine. After graduating, I worked as a graphic designer for six years. Despite the work experiences gained, Iâ€™ve always encouraged myself to continue learning and building on my skills. I enrolled myself in a Design Track program with Bloc, where I spent over 800 hours learning best design practices from professionals in the field.</p>
          <p>When Iâ€™m not designing, you can catch me at Disneyland eating a turkey leg.</p>

        <h3>My Design Process</h3>
        <div class="design-process">
          <h4>Strategy</h4>
          <p>I ask a lot of questions, but Iâ€™m not trying to be annoying. I want to make sure that I am aligned with your expectations for a project. This stage of the process includes doing market and competitive analysis research.</p>
          <h4>Structure</h4>
          <p>Who doesnâ€™t like a great foundation? At this stage, I analyze data received from my research to prioritize user stories that would determine the information heirarchy of the project. Here is where the MVP is created.</p>
          <h4>Visual Design</h4>
          <p>The best designs are the ones that evoke feelings. I convert wireframes into their final design look. In order to provide the best experience of the product, I create a dynamic prototype that displays the final results before having it sent to development.</p>

          <h5>What people think of me</h5>
          <p class="slider__txt">"I have had the pleasure of working with Christie at Bloc. She exhibits great attention to detail and it is reflected in the work she produces. She is easy to work with and her communication skills help in identifying challenges early. Christie has exhibited working habits that would benefit any company. I enjoy how motivated she is in continually learning, as it is truly an asset to be consciously aware and the enhancement of skills in this ever-changing landscape in design and technology."</p>

          <h5>What people think of me</h5>
          <p class="slider__txt">"Christie was my UX/Product design student during her time at Thinkful. I have seen Christie grow to become a talented, confident and proactive designer that uses a process-driven design approach. She is capable to turn abstract concepts into delightful experiences from start to finish whilst keeping the user in mind throughout the process. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a switched on UX/Product designer.</p>

We frequently work in tandem with each other, as is essential for marketing and design to do. She is a wonderful coworker who brings creativity and positivity to our team. I have seen her grow - becoming our team's lead designer - as key contributor to our development. She is cooperative, have excellent communication skills, and is a pleasure to work with."</p>

During the year we worked together, I relied heavily on her creative direction, precision, and speed to scale marketing operations across online and offline channels. Without Christie's partnership, my team and I would not have been able to achieve our marketing department's aggressive goals. I'm eager to see what she tackles next and hope that one day our paths cross again!"</p>
