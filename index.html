          <h2>Me in a Nutshell.</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Christie and I am a designer. Growing up, art has always been a part of my life. I have a bachelors in Fine Arts and a minor in Digital Arts from the University of California, Irvine. After graduating, I worked as a graphic designer for six years. Despite the experiences gained at my workplaces, I’ve always encouraged myself to continue learning and expanding my horizons. I enrolled myself in a Designer Track program with Bloc, where I spent over 800 hours learning best design practices from professionals in the field. I  apply UX Research, Visual Design, and Front-end Development to my projects to create a more delightful experience for users.</p>
            <p>When I’m not working, you can find me at Disneyland eating a corndog.</p>

          <div class="strategy">
            <h4>Strategy</h4>
            <p>I ask a lot of questions, but I’m not trying to be annoying. I want to make sure that I am aligned with your expectations for a project. This stage includes doing market research and competitive analysis.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="structure">
            <h4>Structure</h4>
            <p>Who doesn’t like a great foundation? At this stage, I analyze data received from my research to prioritize user stories that would determine the information heirarchy of the project. Here is where the MVP is created.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="visual-design">
            <h4>Visual Design</h4>
            <p>The best designs are the ones that evoke feelings. I convert wireframes into their final design look. In order to provide the best experience of the product, I create a dynamic prototype that displays the final results before having it sent to development.</p>
