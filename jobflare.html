        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>JobFlare is a mobile application that helps users connect to companies. JobFlare has six 90-second brain games that track performance in skills that are key predictors of job success: math ability, verbal ability, attention to detail, and memory. The more stars a user earns, the more it helps users stand out to companies. As the UI designer, my primary role was to design the mobile interface of JobFlare. I worked with the marketing team and engineer team to create features that would increase the number of downloads, as well as, lengthen a player’s time in the app.</p>

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>JobFlare is often accompanied by its' tagline "Play Games. Get Hired". It’s extremely catchy and is a huge factor to why we have downloads. However, we encountered a problem with our users where users would play through our six games, and then drop off. After the six games were played through, users expected the app to guide them to their next step. The users feel as if the app doesn't work because there are no actions that happen after they play through the games. Therefore, we needed to provide feedback back to the users in order for them to continue game play. We recognized through the data from Mixed Panel that our users dropped off after they had completed playing through all six games. We needed to figure out a solution that would increase a player's retention in our application primarily through game play. One of the main projects I designed was to create a breadcrumb trail to inspire more game play for users. With more games being played, we would see an improvement of scores. This would then give users a better chance of being reached out to from companies that we worked with.</p>

        <h4>Design Process</h4>
        <p>I started off with doing some research on studying the nature of games. I looked specifically at mobile games that were simple, but incredibly addicting to play. I started looking at Flappy Bird and Candy Crush. Originally our solution as a team was that, we should create more games so that users wouldn't lose interest. However, if you look at other mobile games, you see that the game is overall the same, but game became more difficult as more levels are unlocked. I also looked into other platforms to do some research, such as Pinterest. While I was scrolling through Pinterest, there was one game that caught my eye, and that was a screenshot of OverCooked. For those that haven't played OverCooked before, it's a game on Nintendo Switch that features a more team- based game. As a team, you are required to create food items, and have them delivered out. The game requires team work and constant communication. When you pass different levels, the food items required for you to make become more and more difficult. After each game, there's a post game menu that shows up that shows your overall results from the game. If you did great, you can get three out of three stars. The star icon was also a big part of our own game, so we liked how we could also incorporate their idea into our own post game screen. We recognized that our games weren't challenging or addicting because it never challenged users to play more and more difficult levels. The game level of difficulty were always the same for each game. Therefore, I pitched the idea of creating a world map for each game. We would start off with limiting each game to five levels. Each level would be more difficult to achieve. A set number of answers must be correct in order for players to move onwards to the next level.</p>

      <div class="image-two"></div>
    </div>
    <section class="results">
        <p>Before designing, I organized the user stories given by the product team, and arranged the elements onto the screen. The very top of the screen will give users the ability to navigate to the past screen, which is signified by the arrow icon. On the right-hand side, there will by copy for a game tutorial. Underneath it all, we have the game icon, followed by the title and a visual of the game map. The game map will feature five different levels, and will show users what levels they have unlocked and vice versa. The CTA button allows, the users to select which level they want to play and move them forward to the game. If they tap play without selecting a level, the app will automatically guide them to the last level they unlocked.</p>

        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>The results of adding the level maps increased player retention within the app. We also noticed a greater conversion of players that gained higher star ratings. With the next update to the games, we wanted to apply more design by creating different backgrounds and introducing new characters for the different levels. The team also expressed enthusiasm in bringing the games onto a social platform where players can feel more connected within a community.</p>
