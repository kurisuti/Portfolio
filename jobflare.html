        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>JobFlare is a mobile application that helps connect players to companies. JobFlare has six 90-second brain games that track performance in key predictors of job success: math ability, verbal ability, attention to detail, and memory. The more stars a playeer gets, the more it helps players to stand out to companies. As the UI designer, I was primarily focused on creating the interface of JobFlare. I worked with the marketing team and engineer team to create features that would increase the number of downloads, as well as, lengthen a player’s time in the app.</p>

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>The tagline behind JobFlare is “Play Games, Get Hired”. It’s extremely catchy and it doesn’t lie to users. However, with users that download the app, they expect to play the list of games and wait for companies to reach out to them. They don’t go back to improve on their scores, or go forth into exploring the jobs tab for job opportunities. The team noticed through mixed panel that there was a drop off in players after the first six games were played through. Players did not receive any type of bread crumb trail on how to further engage in the app. There were features created in the app that players didn’t know existed. One of the main projects I had was to create a breadcrumb trail to inspire more game play. With more games played and scores improving, this gave players a better opportunity to be noticed by companies and improved their chances to be hired.</p>

        <h4>Design Process</h4>
        <p>I started off with doing some research on how games apps are effective. Clearly, some games such as Angry Bird or Candy Crush have the same type of game play, but the games are addicting to play. I wanted to understand the behavior of game play in order to make JobFlare games more sticky for our players. I was on Pinterest searching “games”, and this is where Overcooked appeared. I had played the game countless times in group settings. The games were challenging and addicting. The game play was all the same, work as a team to deliver dishes out. When you elevated to different levels, the tasks became more and more difficult. Our games were missing out on the whole idea of levels. There was no purpose to continue game play if you felt the the levels were always the same. Therefore, I pitched the idea of creating a world map for each game. We would start off with limiting each game to five levels. Each level would be more difficult to achieve. A set number of answers must be correct in order for players to move onwards to the next level.</p>

    <section class="results">
        <h4>Results</h4>
        <p>The results of adding the level maps increased player retention within the app. We also noticed a greater conversion of players that gained higher star ratings. With the next update to the games, we wanted to apply more design by creating different backgrounds and introducing new characters for the different levels. The team also expressed enthusiasm in bringing the games onto a social platform where players can feel more connected within a community.</p>
