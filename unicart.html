    <article class="problem">
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>With the e-commerce platform growing, I noticed that people were starting to shop online rather than in person. With how easy and convenient online shopping is, it only takes one click to open multiple browser tabs to different retail stores. As an online shopper, it’s a hassle to have to go through each web browser, and go through multiple checkout processes.</p>
    </article>
  <!--solution-->
    <section class="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><p><b>Browser Extension Tool:</b> The tool is non-intrusive and can be opened and closed easily. With each item added to a cart from other retail stores, UniCart also populates the same items.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>One Step Checkout:</b> Goodbye to multiple sign in and checkout processes. Once shoppers set their payment, shipping, and billing info, UniCart uses the information and charges all the different retail stores.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Wishlist:</b> UniCart tells users the availability of an item. If items are out of stock, then users can choose to save the item in their wishlist.</p></li>

    <section class="discovery">
      <h2>Discovery Phase</h2>
        <p>When starting this project, I wanted to learn more about my user’s behavior with online shopping and browser extensions. I also wanted to see my user’s experience with browser extensions. How did they use it, and what were they using it for?</p>
        <p>Based on my survey results, 71% of users preferred shopping online versus in-person. During a browsing session, about 65% of users had at least 3-7 tabs opened at a time. When participants were asked on how they managed their tabs, 77% of users said they just remove tabs as they browse. Most users did their shopping online because it is convenient, websites are available 24/7, and it is an easy checkout process.</p>

          <span class="dot" onclick="currentSlide(3)"></span>
        </div>

        <p>Apart from the positives from online-shopping, I also wanted to ask participants about their negative experiences with it. 47% of users complained about the quality of the items, and others complained about the checkout process and returns.</p>
        <p>The next part of the survey was to talk about browser extensions. On a scale of 1-10, participants were asked how important browser extensions were to them. 47% of users gave browser extensions a 6. 67% of participants used extensions to block ads and to shop. 60% of users used AdBlock and 20% used Honey. I went further to ask about positive and negative experiences they had with browser extensions. 60% said they used extensions because it helped block annoying ads.</p>
        <p><b>“AdBlocker makes my entire online experience more enjoyable...”</b></p>
        <p>26% of users say they use extensions to save money. For negative experiences, sometimes the extensions didn’t work as expected. For example, Honey (a browser extension that helps you save money by finding coupons) was useless because sometimes it either gave</p>
        <p><b>“...the same/worse discounts that were already offered”.</b></p>
        <p>Some of the extensions distracted from browsing, and users would prefer that they were less obtrusive.</p>
        <p>The next section of the survey was to test out some features that I believed would be important to have for UniCart. I wanted to see what features my UniCart shopping list needed to have, and how important having these features would be. These features would eventually become user stories for my product. 53% of users believed that it was important to have the ability to add items to your shopping cart. 87% of users wanted to see the price of an item when added to the cart. 67% of users wanted to see the name and description of the items in my cart. 60% of users wanted the ability to edit items inside of their shopping cart. The only feature that wasn’t appealing to users was the date for when the item was added to the cart.</p>

    <section class="competitive-analysis">
      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>After having done some user research, I started looking into my market research. The three competitors that I looked into were Honey, Adblock, and CamelCamelCamel.</p>
        <p><b>Honey:</b> Honey is an online coupon extension that works on both desktop and has their own mobile application. It helps users find and apply coupon codes when a user is ready to check out. Their priority is to help users improve their shopping experience by saving a user’s time to find coupons. When users create an account with Honey, they have the abilities to gain Honey Gold, which users can then use to purchase gift cards. Weaknesses that Honey has is that their mobile app doesn’t work the same way as its’ extension browser, so users are often disappointed. Also coupons that are shown on the browser and the mobile app are sometimes not consistent.</p>
        <p><b>AdBlock:</b> AdBlock focuses on providing a worry-free and distraction-free internet experience for their users. Their target audience are mainly concerned with ads that can disrupt their browsing activity. AdBlock is free to download and can work on both desktop and mobile phone. Some of the weaknesses from AdBlock is that they don’t block all advertisements. For a fee, AdBlock will allow ads to be shown. Also some websites deny users access to their website if they have their AdBlock on.</p>
        <p><b>CamelCamelCamel:</b> CamelCamelCamel provides data to use on the price history of products. They provide users information on when is the best time to buy a product. They only track prices and products that are sold on Amazon, but doesn’t clearly state who the third party sites are. It has a feature in which users can set alerts on items to purchase later on. It has a poor landing page that some users may think that the site looks fake. Last weakness that it has is that most of their audience aren’t in a rush to make a purchase and that can often lead them to not making a project.</p>

        <p>Having gained a better understanding of my users and marketspace. It was time to create user stories and user flows.

These flows would illustrate user paths in the product achieving high priority user story tasks.</p>

        <h2>Initial Sketches</h2>
        <p>By understanding my user flows, I started sketching out how the screens would look like. For each user flow, I did three to four different sketch iterations. This helped me find the best possible design layout. I would use Figma to digitally design these sketches into wireframes.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="Images/unicart/unicart-wireframe.png"  alt="unicart wireframes">
        <p>The wireframe sketches done above was an exploration of how the landing page would look like once the user completes sign up. In creating different iterations of the landing page, it helped me identify which layout create the best user flow. I also looked into exploring the onboarding process of a new user. I created sketches on how a path of a new user would look in comparison to an existing user. From here, I selected the sketches I wanted to move forward with and made digital renditions of them.</p>

    <section class="wireframe">
      <p>With the wireframe prototype, I had three in-person usability tests. Each user had four tasks that they needed to complete.</p>
      <p><b>Task 1: Sign up for an account</b><br><b>Task 2: Creating a new piece of content</b><br><b>Task 3: Organize content</b><br><b>Task 4: Quick description of what each menu icon does</b></p>
      <p>As I observed the partcipants, I saw that each user had no problem signing up for account. They were able to create a new file, however, the ellipsis next to the file name was a little confusing. They simply assumed a drag and drop into the folder would be the action used into adding a file into a folder. All menu tab items were accurately depicted (All Files, Add Documents, Collaborate, Upgrade Account, and Settings), but users were unsure the differences between the Collaboration tab and the All Files tab. One user wanted to see a stronger difference.</p>

        <h2>High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>I took the feedback from my usability test and started to mock-up a high-fidelity wireframe of unicart. I added a sidebar to file creation that would show owners of the projects. Users in a shared project would be able to see recent activities done to the project. Collaborative projects also had the commenting section in order to enable better communication skills within teams.</p>
        <p>I chose to go with a green as the accent color for unicart. I thought that it was a nice change from the usual blue software color, and that it could be distinguished within the marketplace.</p>

    <!--branding & identity-->
    <section class="branding">
        <h2>Branding & Identity Phase</h2>
        <div class= >
        <p>The first steps in branding was identifying my target audience, which in this case were remote professionals. Having worked as a freelancer for five years, I understood that one of the key struggles I had was not feeling part of a whole. Oftentimes, details and direction of a project can get lost in translation. All I wanted was more clarity and transparency. I wanted those two words to reflect the values of this product. I liked the word “Clear” used in the product, for it could be interpreted in many ways. For some, it can mean having full transparency, which can eliminate points of cloudiness. I went with the name unicart because it represented the idea of creating your own personal workspace and being able to feel part of a whole.</p>
      </div>
        <img src="Images/unicart/unicart-Logo-Creation.png" alt="branding">
        <h2>Logo Design</h2>
        <p>From the word clear, I was able to branch out to other words that I helped me identify the brand. Some of these words included being transparent, reliable, adaptable, useful, motivational, etc. I used words created from my mind mapping execise to start sketching logo ideas out. I wanted a logo that showed transparency and layers. The logo needed to reflect the name of unicart, as well as, incorporates elements of a workspace in a minimalistic way. The logo would come off as professional, and so I created the logo primarily with geometric shapes.</p>
        <img src="Images/unicart/unicart-Palette.png" alt="palette">
        <h2>Color Palette</h2>
        <p>The next step was establishing the mood board which would come to aid my decision for the color palette. This was personally my favorite part of branding. I searched for images that I thought best represented our product, yet still tied in with the words from the mind map. I drew inspiration from offices that had a lot of natural light, organic natural woods, and plants. I liked the mix of greenery, natural organic material, and industrial spaces all merged together. I used the eye picker to select certain colors that popped out to me. The main accent color that I chose for unicart was a fresh green. I wanted to stay away from blue because it is often a color used in software products. I wanted to make the product visually unique. It also served as a visual challenge for me to work with a color which can be seen as opposite from technology. However, green often reflects growth, and I believe that is what unicart is. It's a platform built to serve a new incoming line of working professionals.</p>
        <img src="Images/unicart/unicart-MoodBoard.png" alt="moodboard">
    <!--user testing phase-->
        <p>The idea behind the first draft of the high fidelity mock-up was to incorporate stock photo images of work spaces and young working professionals. As stated above in the branding, I used green as an accent color, and incorporated warmer/neutral tones to help balance out the whitespace on the screens. As I added this style throughout the rest of the product, I wanted to do a quick preference testing to see how users felt on some particular screens that I was curious about. I tested out two different color variations, layout, and button placement.</p>

      <p>I decided to do a second round of testing in order to add the changes done from my preference testing. The results of this testing would lead to big changes from V2 to my final design look.</p>

      <p>The only key difference the screens had was the ability to view notes and screen share for collaborative projects. I originally thought collaboration should be a separate tab in itself because it was a highly sought out feature from my user surveys. However, it was such a minor difference of functionality between the two, so I decided to combine the “Collaborate” tab into the “My Files” tab. All files that are shared will be allowed the feature to share notes and screen share.</p>

      <p><b>Settings was difficult to find.</b></p>
      <img src="Images/unicart/settings-screenshot.png" alt="settings screenshot">
      <p>Users didn’t seem to notice that the profile image would have a drop down to access settings. Since I had some extra real estate on my left menu bar, I decided to add a tab that featured “Settings”. This way users had two ways in accessing “Settings”.</p>

      <img src="Images/unicart/brandingconsistency.png" alt="homepage and product">
      <p>The user said unicart didn’t quite match the look and feel of the website landing page. She wanted to see more clear/layered effects that would match the style of the logo. When this was brought to my attention, I looked into creating a more transparent platform for my users in which they could feel comfortable working in. I created a feature within settings that would allow users to customize their workspace. The side menu bar can be changed based on where ever the remote professional was at.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I believe that I identified a great target audience for the product. I was able to identify patterns in how more jobs are becoming remote. I used my observations as an advantage to finding my audience.</p>
        <p>In considering future developments of the current product, I want to send out surveys targeting remote work professionals. From the surveys, I’m hoping to create more features that are geared towards my specific audience. I liked how I used my personal experiences as a freelancer to help my drive unicart’s branding. In the next steps of design, I’d like to place my focus in having the product be more malleable to the user.</p>
        <p>I believe these goals listed above can be achieved through user research, ideation, prototyping, wireframing and usability testings.</p>
