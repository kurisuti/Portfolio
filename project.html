        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>My client saw an opportunity to enter into the cloud storage market, and hired our agency to come up with a product that would be able to compete within this market space. The problem faced with making this product was finding a unique approach that would help our product stand out amongst big-name competitors like Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Evernote, etc. I needed to create a product that would meet the needs of a specific audience.</p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><p><b>New Audience:</b> I noticed a trend on job boards where more job opportunities were remote. This was an audience that I would place my research on.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Create, Organize, Share:</b> I sent out user surveys to understand how users used cloud storage services. The results showed that I needed to build a platform where users can create, organize, and share.</p></li>
          <li><p><b>Personalized Platform:</b> Part of ClearBox’s values as a brand was to allow users feel as if any environment can be turned to their own personal workspace. Users are encouraged to customize their platform, so that the product feels catered to them.</p></li>

    <!--discovery phase-->
    <section class="discovery">
        <h3>Discovery Phase</h3>
        <p>At the start of the project, I wanted to learn more about my users and their involvement with cloud storage services. The results showed that a majority of my survey participants were full-time professionals and were in their mid twenties and early thirties. Google Drive was heavily favored as their product of choice. It was preferred because Google Drive was easy to use and worked seamlessly on multiple devices. After establishing my participant’s demographic, I wanted to look into how they were engaging with cloud storage services. Understanding their usage would help me create my user stories. Results showed that half of participants used it for personal reasons while 40% of users used it for work. This gave me the idea of creating a service that would serve as a project management platform.</p>

        <div class="discovery-image"></div>
    <section class="discovery">
        <p>While going over the project brief with the client, the client had features that they wanted included in the product. They believed this features were important for users to have. Therefore I created a separate section in my survey that tested out these features. The features that the client wanted to have dealt with file creation, organization, sharing, and collaboration. </p>

            <li><i class="fas fa-circle"></i></li>
          </ul>
        <p>Apart from just looking at positive experiences that participants had with cloud storage services, I also wanted to look at the negatives. The biggest complaint from participants was not having enough storage space, and not enjoying monthly subscription plans. By researching on market competitors, I looked into creating plans that would provide users with more free storage space, and allowed users to sign up with annual subscriptions.</p>

        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>I had an ample amount of research on potential users, and wanted to transition my attention to competitors in the market space. The three competitors I looked into was Google Drive, DropBox, and Evernote. As I looked into their strengths and weaknesses, I noticed a pattern. For most part, the features provided to users were similar in the three competitors. However, what made them different was their target audience, and to whom they marketed their platform for. Google Drive’s targeted every day users, but specifically small business owners. DropBox seeked out creatives by marketing their feature DropBox page which allowed teams to work together on one project. Lastly, EverNote was geared towards students and focused their product on note taking. What I took out of this research was that I needed to find my own specific audience.</p>

        <p>Having gained a better understanding of my users and marketspace. It was time to create user stories and user flows. User stories helped me prioritize the main features that would be included in the product. Then these user stories were converted into user flows through Figma. These flows would illustrate user paths in the product achieving high priority user story tasks.</p>

    <!--branding & identity-->
    <section class="brand">
        <h3>Branding & Identity Phase</h3>
        <p>The first steps in branding was identifying my target audience, which in this case were remote professionals. Having worked as a freelancer for five years now, I understood that one of the key struggles I had was not feeling part of a whole. Oftentimes, details and direction on a project can get lost in translation. All I wanted was more clarity and transparency. I liked the word “Clear” used in the product, for it could be interpreted in many ways. For some, it can mean having full transparency, which can eliminate points of cloudiness. I went with the name ClearBox because it represented the idea of creating your own personal workspace and being able to feel part of a whole.</p>
        <h3>Logo Design</h3>
        <p>From the word clear, I was able to branch out to other words that I believed would help identify the brand. Some of these words included being transparent, reliable, adaptable, useful, motivational, etc. I used words created from my mind mapping execise to start sketching logo ideas out. I wanted a logo that showed transparency and layers. The logo needed to reflect the name of ClearBox as well as incorporates elements of a workspace in a minimalistic way. The logo would come off as professional, and so most of the shapes used in the logo were geometric.</p>
        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <p>The next step was establishing the mood board which would come to aid my decision for the color palette. This was personally my favorite part of branding. I searched for images that I thought best represented our product, yet still tied in with the words from the mind map. I drew inspiration from offices that had a lot of natural light, organic natural woods, and plants. I liked the mix of greenery and organic textures amongst industrial spaces. I used the eye picker to select certain colors that popped out to me. The main accent color used is green. I wanted to stray away from blue because it is often a color used in software products. I wanted to make the product visually unique, and at the same time have it serve as a design challenge for myself.</p>

    <!--user testing phase-->
    <section class="user-testing">
        <h3>User Testing Phase</h3>
        <p>The idea behind the first draft of the high fidelity mock-up was to incorporate stock photo images of work spaces and young working professionals. As stated above in the branding, I used green as an accent color. I also incorporated some warmer/neutral tones to help balance out the whitespace on the screens. As I added this style throughout the rest of the product, I wanted to do a quick preference testing to see how users felt on some particular screens that I had some design curiosity in. I tested out different color variation, layout, and button placement. Below are three screens that I  tested, which 2 designs each:</p>

    <section class="preference-testing">
        <h3>Preference Testing</h3>
        <p>What color do you prefer? 83% of users chose the second design.</p>

            <img src="Images/preference-test-6.png" alt="preferencetest-6">
          </div>
    </section>
    <!--user testing part 2-->
    <section class="user-testing">
          <p>Based on the preference testing, an overwhelming amount of users were more into the dark blue menu for the dashboard. This would be a major change in my second draft of high-fidelity mockups. I was also able to execute the screens users chose in the other preference tests, so made those adjustments as well.</p>
          <h3>User Testing Part 2</h3>
          <p>I decided to do a second round of testing in order to add the changes done from my preference testing. The results of this testing drastically changed the look of my design. A number of users had complained that the “My Files” tab and “Collaboration” tab were too similar in look and functionality to one another. The only difference the screen had was the ability to view notes and screen share for collaborative projects. Originally in my mind, I thought collaboration should be a separate tab in itself, because it was a highly sought out feature from my user surveys. However, the way I designed it out didn’t make it too different from “My Files”. Therefore, I decided to combine the “Collaborate” tab into the “My Files” tab. All files that are shared will be allowed the feature to share notes and screen share. The other comment that was made was that settings was difficult to find. Users didn’t seem to notice that the profile image would have a drop down to access settings. Since I had some extra real estate on my left menu bar, I decided to add a tab that featured “Settings”. This way users had two ways in accessing “Settings”. Lastly, one user had commented in adding a breadcrumb trail just to help users track their steps in the product. The breadcrumbs would allow easy shortcuts for users to jump to different screens.</p>
          <p>One comment that caught me by surprise was when a user couldn’t see how the branding was shown in the product itself. She said the landing page of the website didn’t quite match the same feeling in the product and that she wanted to see more transparent effects that would match the style of the logo. When this was brought to my attention, I realized that I had left out a crucial part of my branding out. I originally named the product ClearBox because it was a platform in which users could feel less alone. They would be able to customize the look and feel of their workspace to match whichever setting they were in. In my final iteration of my design, I seeked to make the product more personable by allowing users to change their background skin on the settings page.</p>

                <h3>Customize Your Workspace</h3>
                <p>Since remote professionals aren’t tied to any space, the ability to customize their workspace allows users to change their settings where ever they are at.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>I believe that I identified a great target audience for the product. I was able to look at the transition of jobs becoming more and more remote. I used my observations as an advantage to finding my audience.</p>
          <p>In considering future developments of the current product, I want to send out surveys targeting remote work professionals. From the surveys, I’m hoping to create more features that are gauged towards my specific audience. I liked how I used my personal experiences as a freelancer to help my drive ClearBox’s branding. In the next steps of design, I’d like to place my focus in having the product be more malleable to the user.</p>
          <p>I believe these goals listed above can be achieved through user research, ideation, prototyping, wireframing and usability testings.</p>
